# Contributing to Categories API Exercise

Thank you for your interest in this code review exercise!

## For Candidates

This repository is designed as an interview exercise. Please follow the instructions in the main README.md file to complete your code review.

### Submission Guidelines

When submitting your code review:

1. **Format**: Submit as a markdown document, PDF, or in the format requested by your interviewer
2. **Structure**: Organize issues by severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
3. **Clarity**: Be specific about the location and nature of each issue
4. **Solutions**: Suggest fixes for the issues you identify
5. **Positivity**: Also mention what the code does well

### What We're Looking For

- Attention to detail
- Understanding of security principles
- Knowledge of ASP.NET Core best practices
- API design understanding
- Code quality awareness
- Testing mindset
- Clear communication skills

## For Interviewers/Maintainers

### Adding New Issues

When adding new intentional issues to the code:

1. Document it in `SOLUTION_GUIDE.md`
2. Categorize by severity
3. Ensure it's realistic (something that could happen in real code)
4. Make sure the code still compiles and tests pass

### Modifying the Exercise

Feel free to:
- Add more endpoints
- Introduce additional types of issues
- Adjust the complexity level
- Add more comprehensive tests (or break existing ones intentionally)

When modifying, remember to:
- Update the README.md
- Update the SOLUTION_GUIDE.md
- Verify the project still builds: `dotnet build`
- Verify tests still pass: `dotnet test`

### Best Practices for This Exercise

1. **Keep it realistic**: Issues should be things that could realistically slip through in a real PR
2. **Balance difficulty**: Mix critical, major, and minor issues
3. **Maintain variety**: Cover different categories (security, code quality, testing, etc.)
4. **Keep it focused**: Don't overwhelm with too many issues - 8-12 is a good range
5. **Document everything**: Keep SOLUTION_GUIDE.md up to date
